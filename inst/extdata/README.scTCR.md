## Side panel.
Upload the file. This can be from our QC section or alternative sources. 
The other features in the side panel are 
- 'Type of group'
  + This is used to change the comparison. We recommend either using "group","indiv" or "group.indiv". 
- 'Type of data'
  + This segregates out if the original file was 'raw' or 'summarized'
- 'Type of font' 
  + Specify the font for the figures. the R default fonts are serif, sans and mono. Additional fonts were found on https://fonts.google.com (email Kerry if there is a specific font you would like to use.)
