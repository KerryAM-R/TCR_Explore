### Overview of TCR pairing

#### summary table

The user can specify the type of summary table to download. 

They can either select their own columns (general summary) or downlaod as TCRdist3 .csv output.

For the TCRdist3, there is a need to use our QC process as it matches the IMGT column names. 

There is also a need to select if the input data is either alpha-beta (ab) or gamma-delta (gd) for the TCRdist3 column selection.

#### Treemap
The user can specify: 
- The order of the group (i.e. CD8 and IFNg)
- colour choices include: default, rainbow, random or one colour (specified in side panel) 
    + The colour can be altered afterwards
- If they want the labels to appear on the graph
- Column to colour as well as column to separate the panel
- This plot can be downloaded as a PNG or PDF

#### Chord diargram

There are several features the user can specify:
- Sub-group to display
- The user can select the two columns used to display in the chord diagram
- The transparency of the 'Label' and 'no label' is for the entire data set
- There is also an option to selectively label one or more, where the transparency and lines can be added
- Colour choices: default, rainbow, random or one colour (specified in side panel) 
- Labels can be added or removed if needed 
- Legend is not displayed for any of the graphs
- This plot can be downloaded as a PNG or PDF

#### Pie chart
There are several features the user can specify:
- Displays one chain
- The user can alter what is displayed as either: group or indiv.group
- The amount of rows can be specified
- The legend location can be altered as well as the size of the text
- Colour choices: default, random or one colour (specified in side panel) 
- This plot can be downloaded as a PNG or PDF

#### CDR3 length distribution
The length distribution presented is by the unique CDR3 sequences.

The user can specify:
- the type of graph
  + histogram, which can be coloured by specific chains (i.e. Colour by: AVJ)
  + Density plot, coloured by Column of group (side panel)
- The CDR3 sequences (amino acid or nucleotide)
- The size of the text
- x-axis range (default 1 to 30) and tick mark interval
- The user can also download the summarised table with the lengths or colours that were used 
- This plot can be downloaded as a PNG or PDF

#### Single length motif analysis

The nucleotide and amino acid plots show the unique sequences of a certain length

these are displayed as 'Motif (amino acid)' and 'Motif (nucleotide)'
