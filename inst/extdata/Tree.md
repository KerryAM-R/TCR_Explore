### summary table

The user can specify the type of summary table to download. 

They can either select their own columns (general summary) or downlaod as TCRdist3 .csv output.

For the TCRdist3, there is a need to use our QC process as it matches the IMGT column names. 

There is also a need to select if the input data is either alpha-beta (ab) or gamma-delta (gd) for the TCRdist3 column selection.
