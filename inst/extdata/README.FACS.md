### Creating the column to colour dotplot

Things to do before uploading the file
- rename headers as desired (i.e. CD69)
- Remove unwanted columns (i.e. Time)

Upload the file

To identify the sequences that are clonal, select all columns except those of the flurochromes.

Creating the files
- select the gene column and corresponding CDR3 column (repeat for both chains)
- Select the # of clones cut-off i.e. >1 clone
- Downlaod the file

Note: I would recommend leaving the clonal filter at 1. I would then copy these columns in excel followed by removing unwanted clones rather than having to redo this step. 

### The dot plot of selected clones

Upload the colour file

Select the following:
- x-axis column
- y-axis column
- adding in a histogram
- Column to colour by 
- size, location and number of columns for the legend
    + If using histograms, place legend below or to the left
- Type of colouring scheme: Default, random or grey
    + all colours can be altered
- download as either a .png or PDF
